Trestle is an experimental spatio-temporal reasoner originally developed at the Univeristy of Washington.

It's designed to facilitate the integration of complex spatio-temporal data across disparate datasets. 
Underneath, the application uses an RDF database and an OWL ontology to facilitate integration.

The project is currently being ported from the original closed-source repositories and more documentation will be added at a later date.
